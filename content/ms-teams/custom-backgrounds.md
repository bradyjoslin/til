To enable a background image turn on your video camera and select the triple-dot icon. Select `Show Background Effects`. From here you can blur your background or set the background to one of the available images.

You can also add custom images by places image files in a specific location on your computer.

Custom background directory on:

- Mac: `~/Library/Application Support/Microsoft/Teams/Backgrounds/Uploads`
- Windows: `%AppData%\Microsoft\Teams\Backgrounds\Uploads`

This let's you do fun things like add a [Max Headroom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Headroom) background.
