title = "Disable Natural Trackpad Scrolling"

The default scroll direction for macOS mimics the behavior of a touchscreen, where swiping up scrolls down and swiping down scrolls up. Great for touchscreens, but unnatural for a trackpad. Good news is you can turn this off.

`System Preferences -> Trackpad -> Scroll & Zoom -> Uncheck Scroll direction: Natural`
