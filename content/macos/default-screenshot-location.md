title = "Default Screenshot Location"

On macOS the default location for screenshots is the desktop, but cluttered desktops are no fun. To change the default screenshot location:

Open terminal and enter:

`defaults write com.apple.screencapture location {your-folder-name}`

Now all new screenshots will be saved to {your-folder-name}.
